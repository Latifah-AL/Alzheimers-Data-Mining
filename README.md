# Alzheimer’s Disease Data Mining

This project was developed as part of the **IT-326: Data Mining** course.  
The project analyzes clinical and demographic patient data to **predict Alzheimer’s diagnosis** and **identify patient clusters**. It demonstrates how Python and data mining techniques can be used to extract patterns, make predictions, and provide actionable insights.

## Project Overview
Alzheimer’s Disease Data Mining is a Python-based project that focuses on **classification and clustering techniques**.  
The project applies **Decision Tree classification** to predict patient diagnoses and **K-Means clustering** to group patients based on health and lifestyle factors. It emphasizes data preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation of models for real-world applicability.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **pandas, numpy** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **scikit-learn** – Preprocessing, Decision Tree, K-Means, metrics  
- **matplotlib, seaborn** – Data visualization  

## Features
- Data preprocessing: missing value handling, encoding, normalization  
- Feature selection: top 20 relevant features chosen  
- Classification using Decision Tree (Gini Index & Entropy)  
- Clustering using K-Means (optimal K determined)  
- Model evaluation with accuracy, silhouette score, and elbow method  
- Visualization of clusters and decision boundaries  

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:  
- Applying classification and clustering algorithms in Python  
- Preprocessing and normalizing real-world datasets  
- Selecting relevant features to improve model performance  
- Evaluating and interpreting data mining models  
- Visualizing patterns and clusters in patient data  
- Understanding the end-to-end workflow of a data mining project
